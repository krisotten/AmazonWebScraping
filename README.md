# Web Scraping Price Data from Amazon

In this project, I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to create a function that scrapes data on the title and price of a specific listing on Amazon. The data is then added as a row in a CSV file and the date that the row was added is also recorded. I then automated this function using a while loop that runs the function every 24 hours and appends the new data onto the current CSV file. So, if the price of this item were to change over time then we would know when it changed and by how much.
